## How to run it

You need to have[GNU/GCC compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/)  installed if you are on windows and mac to compile the code. Which can be done by installing [mingw](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/).

### On Windows

If you are willing to run the code on windows machine and have compilers installed you have to perform two commands on terminal to actually run your code.

1. Open your terminal and navigate to code directory
2. Run `g++ <filename>.cpp` which generates a **a.exe** file
3. Run the file using `a.exe` or `a` on terminal.

### On Mac and Linux

Mac and linux have quite similar approach of compiling and executing the code although source code compiled on mac wont work on linux and vice versa.

1. Open your terminal and navigate to code directory
2. Run `g++ <filename>.cpp` which generates a **a.out** file
3. Run the file using `a.out` on terminal.

**ðŸ““ Note:** Replace `<filename>` with your actual file name.
